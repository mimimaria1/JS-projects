Creating projects with HTML, CSS &amp; JAVASCRIPTI
As a starting web developer we need real life excercises to practice what we learn, 
here are a variety of projects to show you what I can and what I've learned through my journey. 

If there is anything you want to say, don't hestitate to contact me. 

Yours sincerely,
Maria
